# PROC REPORT in SAS: A Comprehensive Guide to Data Reporting

## Synopsis
PROC REPORT is a powerful procedure in SAS designed for creating and formatting reports from data sets. It enables users to customize reports with various options for grouping, summarizing, and presenting data in a structured format.

## Documentation
### Purpose
PROC REPORT is primarily used for generating detailed reports in SAS. It offers extensive features for customizing the output, making it ideal for both simple and complex reporting needs. Users can control the layout, formatting, and calculations performed on the data.

### Usage
To invoke PROC REPORT, the basic syntax is:

```sas
PROC REPORT DATA=data-set-name;
   COLUMN variable-list;
   DEFINE variable-name / options;
RUN;
```

- **DATA**: Specifies the data set to be used for report generation.
- **COLUMN**: Lists the variables to be included in the report.
- **DEFINE**: Defines the attributes of each variable, such as display format, summary statistics, and grouping.

### Details
PROC REPORT supports various options, including but not limited to:
- **GROUP**: Groups data by specified variables.
- **SUM**: Computes the sum of a numeric variable.
- **FORMAT**: Applies a specific format to the report output.
- **ORDER**: Controls the order of reports, either ascending or descending.

The procedure also allows for the creation of computed variables, enabling users to perform calculations directly in the report.

## Examples
### Basic Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of PROC REPORT that generates a report of sales data by region:

```sas
DATA sales;
   INPUT Region $ Sales;
   DATALINES;
   North 1000
   South 1500
   East 1200
   West 1300
   ;
RUN;

PROC REPORT DATA=sales;
   COLUMN Region Sales;
   DEFINE Region / GROUP;
   DEFINE Sales / SUM;
RUN;
```

### Advanced Example
An example with computed variables and formatted output:

```sas
DATA employees;
   INPUT Name $ Salary;
   DATALINES;
   John 60000
   Jane 75000
   Mike 50000
   ;
RUN;

PROC REPORT DATA=employees;
   COLUMN Name Salary Salary_Comp;
   DEFINE Salary / SUM FORMAT=COMMA10.;
   COMPUTE Salary_Comp;
      Salary_Comp = Salary / 1000;
      CALL DEFINE(_COL_, 'FORMAT', 'COMMA10.2');
   ENDCOMP;
RUN;
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Missing Options**: Failing to include necessary options in the DEFINE statement can lead to reports that do not display data correctly.
- **Data Types**: Ensure that variables are of the correct data type (numeric or character) to avoid errors during report generation.
- **Order of Operations**: The order in which you define columns and compute variables can affect the output; always review your logic.

### Gotchas
- PROC REPORT does not automatically sort data; if sorting is required, it must be performed using PROC SORT before invoking PROC REPORT.
- Complex calculations within the COMPUTE block may require careful handling of missing values to avoid erroneous outputs.

## One Line Summary
PROC REPORT in SAS is a versatile procedure for creating customizable and detailed reports from data sets, allowing for extensive formatting and calculations.
